On and on, it is uninstalled Python that make my octopress can not deploy though can preview. 
After installed Python, it refresh in a second and the CNAME's problem is solved incidentally. 
Yes, on the official homepage, there is no python mentioned, because it is Linux as default.

How many blogs I hava read and also heard to install Python, but because without Python it works at first. 
So I ignore their suggest.

It's the fault of my opinionated heart.
